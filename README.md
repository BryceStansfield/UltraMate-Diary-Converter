# UltraMate-Diary-Converter
Converts Ultra Mate Diary files to text


To use this converter:
First back up your UltraMate diary in the app and move the backup file to an empty directory on your computer.

Then rename your backup file to "diary" with no file extension.

Place the python file in this directory and run it.

When the python terminal asks you for your time-zone, find your timezone [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) and input the "TZ database name".

Your diary entries will now be in "txt_out" :)




NOTE:
If anyone has any backups that they'd be willing to donate to me, I'd love to have a look. I made this program so a friend could get their old diary back, so unfortunately I wasn't able to look at the file while reverse engineering it. Because of this the program currently doesn't understand the categories and moods attached to diary entries.
